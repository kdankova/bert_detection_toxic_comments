# BERT Fine-Tuning for Toxic Comment Classification

This project fine-tunes the BERT model to classify comments based on toxicity, enhancing performance in identifying negative or offensive comments.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that fine-tunes the BERT model for a toxic comment classification task. Leveraging the transformer architecture, BERT is adapted to distinguish between different types of comments, aiming to filter out toxic content.

## Requirements

    pip install torch transformers pandas scikit-learn


## Results

The notebook outputs metrics for model evaluation, showcasing its effectiveness in toxic comment classification.
